# Huddle Landing Page with Alternating Feature Blocks

This project is my solution for the "Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks" challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge involves building a landing page and aiming to replicate the provided design as closely as possible. I have implemented the solution using HTML and CSS, and the page is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Challenge Description

The goal of the challenge is to recreate the Huddle landing page, which consists of alternating feature blocks. The page layout is provided as a design file, and the task is to translate that design into a functioning webpage.

Key features of the challenge include:

- Alternating sections: The feature blocks alternate in position, with an image on one side and a text block on the other.
- Responsive design: The webpage should be visually appealing and functional on various devices and screen sizes.

The project structure is as follows:

```
